## 📋 Prioritization Framework

### **RICE + Value Score Methodology**

#### **RICE Components**
- **Reach**: Number of customers/users impacted (1-10 scale)
- **Impact**: Business impact per customer (1-5 scale)
- **Confidence**: Certainty of estimates (1-5 scale)
- **Effort**: Development effort in person-weeks (actual estimate)

#### **Value Score Components**

- **Technical Value**: Platform improvement benefit (1-10 scale)
- **Competitive Value**: Competitive advantage gained (1-10 scale)

#### **Combined Prioritization Formula**
```
Priority Score = (RICE Score × 0.6) + (Value Score × 0.4)

RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
Value Score = (Customer Value + Business Value + Technical Value + Competitive Value) / 4
```

### **Prioritization Criteria Matrix**
